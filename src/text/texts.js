    `I’m a full stack JavaScript developer living in Stockholm with a great interest in tech and music. I have been running an event business for several years and now changed careers to follow my passion for web development.

    In addition to my previous employments, I have for several years run the event company NOPH Events together with a colleague. In this industry, it is very much about finding solutions, being creative and flexible, which has suited me as I like to see opportunities in challenges.

    As a person, I am active and spend a lot of time with family and friends where football, golf and traveling are some of the activities we like to spend together.`,
